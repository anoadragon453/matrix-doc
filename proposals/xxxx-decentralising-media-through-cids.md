# MSCNaN: Decentralising Media through CIDs
<sup>Authored by Jan Christian Gr√ºnhage and Andrew Morgan</sup>

Currently, the media API is less decentralised than most other aspects of
matrix. When the homeserver which uploaded a piece of content goes down, the
content is not visible from homeservers who didn't fetch it before. This is
because the mxc URLs are made up of the server name of the sending server and
an opaque media ID. We can't fetch it from other servers than the origin
server because we there is no signature or hash included to verify the
integrity of the file. This proposal modifies the media ID to be a
[CID](https:/github.com/multiformats/cid) (content ID), which (among other
things) includes a hash of the file, so that we can verify the integrity of
the file, both on the server side and the client side.

## Current Behaviour
### Sending
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant C as Client
  participant S as Server
  C->>S: upload file
  S-->>C: return mxc URL
  C->>S: send event with mxc URL
  S-->>C: return event ID
```

### Receiving
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant C as Client
  participant S as Server
  participant O as Origin
  C->>S: req file
  activate S
  opt fetch file
    S->>O: req file
    activate O
    O-->>S: serve file
    deactivate O
  end
  S-->>C: serve file
  deactivate S
```

## Proposal
### Data structures
We propose MXC URLs to change from `mxc://<server>/<opaque ID>` to
`mxc://<server>/<CID>`. We include the server here for backwards
compatibility reasons, so that old servers and clients would still work as
before, and also as a primary source for downloading the media. If that
fails, the server needs a hint where to get the media from instead, which the
client may send to the server as a query parameter.

### Sending
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant S as Server
    C->>S: upload file
    activate S
    S->>S: calculate CID
    S-->>C: return mxc URL with CID
    deactivate S

    opt verify CID
      C->>C: verify the CID
    end

    C->>S: send event with mxc URL
    activate S
    S-->>C: event ID
    deactivate S
```

This as you can see, this is very similar to what happens so far on existing
clients and servers. The client behaviour *can* change, but a client that
does not change it's behaviour will still work as expected. Clients can
additionally verify that a media file is actually as sent by the origin
server, as they now get a hash they can look at for verification.

The server should not use v0 CIDs, it should always use v1 CIDs (until we change
that in the future). The server may implement any number of supported hashes
from the multihash spec for decoding (bikeshedding opportunity: Do we want to
recommend hashes here that we don't recommend sending, for making switching to
other hashes easier in the future?), but it should stick to reasonably
widespread hashes for files it is sending (bikeshedding opportunity: What do
these include? https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec/blob/master/table.csv
has a list of all hashes supported by the multihash spec. SHA2 and SHA3 should
be safe bets).

### Receiving
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant C as Client
  participant S as Server
  participant R as Remote
  C->>S: req file with CID and hint
  Note over C,S: The (optional) hint is a room+event ID
  activate S
  opt fetch file from remote
    loop try potential remotes
      S->>R: req file
      activate R
      R-->>S: serve file
      deactivate R
    end
  end
  S->>S: verify the CID
  S-->>C: serve file
  deactivate S
  opt verify CID
    C->>C: verify the CID
  end
```

Again, very similar to what happens in the current state. You can drop old
implementations into this just fine, everything will continue to work, but
new implementations will be able to verify additional hashes and try more
fallbacks for fetching content.

The client usually trusts it's own server at least somewhat, so it doesn't
need to verify the CID of the file served there, but the server needs to
verify the CID of the file returned by the remote to make sure we don't let
malicious servers serve wrong content for rooms they participate in.

##### Potential remotes
1. Origin encoded in the MXC URL.
2. If the client has supplied explicit fallback servers, try those in the order
   the client supplied them in.
3. If the client has supplied a room+event ID combo as a hint:
	1. Try the servers that used to be in the room back then and still are.
	2. Try the servers that are in the room now but weren't back then.
	3. Try the servers that used to be in the room but aren't anymore. These are
	   tried last to make sure servers leaving a room aren't put under any
	   unnecessary load from that room anymore.

## Potential Issues
 - Multihash and CID are not wide spread outside of IPFS and Protocol Labs.
   There's implementations for a few languages, but this might be an at least
   somewhat limiting factor. Less difficult than E2EE, but still not trivial.

## Alternatives/Related MSCs
1. **MSC2706** proposes to use IPFS directly, but in a similarily backwards
   compatible way to how we're changing MXC URLs here. MSC2706 does make
   authenticating media worse, because it publishes the file to IPFS and that
   is easy to scrape, but that also means that fallback nodes are
   automatically found. Public files in this MSC *could* be put into IPFS in
   the future, maybe as an updated version of MSC2706, without changing the
   MXC URL format again, as we'd already have CIDs here.
1. **MSC2703** specifies a grammer for media IDs, which could be problematic
   for us here. It specifies that media IDs must be opaque, as well as a
   maximum of 255 characters in length. This is in conflict to this MSC (and
   also MSC2706), because we do encode information in the media ID, which
   servers and clients do want to decode. It contains a hash, which should be
   used to verify the integrity of the file that was fetched. The other
   possible conflict with that MSC is the character limit of 255 characters,
   which should not affect this MSC, because a CID is normally 60 characters,
   but that depends on what the CID actually looks like. In the future, a CID
   based on a much longer multihash could mean we run into issues here, but
   this is fairly unlikely, as that would mean hash lengths of over a
   thousand bits.
1. **MSC2834** proposes to replace MXC URLs with custom hash identifier + hash
   strings. This is very similar to what we're doing here, with the difference
   of not reusing preexisting methods like multihash and CIDs.  Also, by
   removing the server name from the MXC URL, it breaks backwards compatibility
   on the server side, and for clients which try to parse the
   MXC URL.
1. **MSCNaN** proposes authentication of media endpoints using events attached
   to the media files. As this MSC also does, it proposes sending the room and
   event ID as query parameters when downloading. It's authentication would also
   help with the potential issue of leaking file contents, as discussed in the
   security considerations section.

## Security considerations
 - Without authentication, this enables fetching of files you know the hash of
   (assuming the hash you know is one the media repo of your server
   supports). This is potentially problematic, as hashes of things are leaked
   in places where access to files are not always leaked as well. For
   example, git commit IDs are SHA1 hashes of the objects, so a commit ID
   could lead to the whole repo (up to that commit) being leaked when the
   objects end up in matrix's media repo. This is a fairly far fetched
   usecase, but it's still an indicator that this might be problematic.
   MSCNaN would help here.

## Backwards Compatibility Concerns
Clients/Servers not implementing this MSC should continue to work normally.
New events sent with non-CID media IDs should not pose a problem either,
because they wouldn't be parsed as CIDs successfully. If they actually are
parsed as CIDs successfully but aren't valid, that's either a huge
coincidence, or, a lot more likely, a malicious MXC URL. In that case, it
would just fail, which is not worse than what malicious MXC URLs can
already do right now.
