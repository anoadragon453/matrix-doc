# MSCNaN: Authentication of Media through Event-Based Attachments
<sup>Authored by Jan Christian Gr√ºnhage and Andrew Morgan</sup>

Currently when a file is uploaded to a homeserver, a MXC URL is created
that allows anyone that possesses it to access that file - even if they do
not have an account on that, or any other homeserver. In practice we often
get around this limitation by sharing files in encrypted rooms - where clients
will automatically encrypt files before uploading them. However, there are many
cases where you may want to share private files in non-encrypted room.

This MSC aims to address authentication of media by linking it and the event
that is sent in the room when the media is shared. With this link, homeservers
can verify whether a user requesting a file has access to view an event, and
thus the ability to access the uploaded media.

## Proposal

### The Attachment

For controlling access to files we reuse event access, attaching event IDs
and room IDs to files. This is the function of attachments. Attachments are
represented by a json blob:
```json
{
  "event_id": "$854tBUEGeaXZOts1uV4E1gC0VfpAPaU4Z1gLEhXZyK4",
  "room_id": "!abcdefghijk:example.com",
  "proof": "multihash(room_id + event_id + file)"
}
```

Instead of attaching an event, a file can also be set to be public. For this,
the following simpler attachment structure is required:

```json
{
  "proof": "multihash('public' + file)"
}
```

The possible keys of an attachment are:

| name | type | description |
| :--- | :--: | :---------- |
| event_id | string | The ID of an event to attach to this file. |
| room_id | string | The ID of the room the event was sent in. <br/>This field is currently required while event IDs are not globally unique. |
| proof | string | A [multihash](https://multiformats.io/multihash/) of the file's contents and either the room ID concatanated with <br/>the event ID or the string 'public'. This ensures that only someone with access <br/>to the file content can then allow others to access the file.

### Uploading:

#### Private Media

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant S as Server
    C->>S: upload media, ?visibility=private
    activate S
    S->>S: calculate MXC URL
    S->>S: store and link MXC URL, user
    S-->>C: return MXC
    deactivate S

    C->>S: send event{MXC URL}, MXC URL
    Note over C,S: We send another MXC URL separately so that <br>1. the server doesn't have to fish it out of the event and <br>2. the server can't read encrypted events
    activate S
    S->>S: check for MXC URL + user link
    S->>S: calculate and store attachment
    S->>S: send event
    S-->>C: event ID
    deactivate S
```

To upload access-controlled media:

1. The client uploads media, sigalling to the server that the media is private,
   and should only be accessible by users that can also read the associated
   event. An example request would look like:
   
   ```
   POST /_matrix/media/r0/upload?visibility=private
   Content-Type: application/pdf

   <bytes>
   ```
   
   The only addition this MSC makes is the `visibility` query parameter. The
   associated event will be sent shortly.
2. The server will calculate an MXC URL in the same way it does today.
3. The server will store an association between the user and the uploaded MXC
   URL. This allows the server to link the media upload and event sending
   requests together.
4. The server will return the MXC URL to the client.
5. Upon receiving the MXC URL, the client will insert it into the event it is
   intending to send. This can be a `m.room.message` with a media-related
   msgtype, or even an `m.room.membership` if the user is setting a profile
   picture that is private to a room.
6. The client will send the event and the MXC URL separately to the server.
   The separation is for two reasons. It is easier than requiring the server to
   fish the MXC URL out of the event, and that the server cannot read encrypted
   events. Sending the MXC URL outside of the event is implemented using another
   new query parameter on an existing endpoint: `mxc_uri`. For example:

   ```
   PUT /_matrix/client/r0/rooms/{roomId}/send/{eventType}/{txnId}?mxc_uri=mxc://example.com/abcde
   
   <event content>
   ```
7. The server will check whether an association exists between the provided
   MXC URL and the user making the request. If one does not, then fail the
   request, as we cannot verify that this user has had access to the file.
8. The server will create and store a private attachment using the event ID,
   room ID and the file's contents, similar to the following:

   ```json
   {
     "event_id": "$854tBUEGeaXZOts1uV4E1gC0VfpAPaU4Z1gLEhXZyK4",
     "room_id": "!abcdefghijk:example.com",
     "proof": "<multihash>"
   }
   ```
9. The server will then send the event containing the MXC URL to all remote
   servers in the room.

#### Public Media

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant S as Server
    C->>S: upload file, (?visibility=public)
    activate S
    S->>S: calculate MXC URL
    S->>S: store and link MXC URL, user
    Note over C,S: We continue to store this mapping in case a<br>private attachment is added later.
    S->>S: calculate and store attachment
    Note over C,S: For public files, we store the attachment in the upload<br>step instead, as public files can be used in instances outside of event sending, such as profile pictures.
    S-->>C: return MXC
    deactivate S

    C->>S: send event{MXC URL}
    activate S
    S->>S: send event
    S-->>C: event ID
    deactivate S
```

To upload public media, the process is much the same as before other than a
small change on the server.

1. The client uploads media, sigalling to the server that the media is
   public, and is accessible to anyone who knows the media identifier. An
   example request would look like:
   
   ```
   POST /_matrix/media/r0/upload?visibility=public
   Content-Type: application/pdf

   <bytes>
   ```
   
   Again the `visibility` parameter is used and set to "public". The
   parameter may also be omitted, as "public" is default.
2. The server will calculate an MXC URL in the same way it does today.
3. The server will store and link the user and the MXC URL.


#### The `visibility` query parameter

A new query parameter is added to the `POST /_matrix/media/r0/upload` endpoint called
`visibility`, due to the phrase being commonly used to assert access to an
entity across the Matrix specification. There are two possible values for this parameter:

* `private` - the uploaded file is intended to be private and an attachment must
  be uploaded separately before this file can be accessed.
* `public` - the uploaded file can be accessed by anybody who has the MXC URL.

The default is `public`, for backwards compatibility purposes.

#### Downloading:
This is limited to the "all good" case for private files. Things like public
files, and denied access are left out to make the diagram more readable.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant C as Client
  participant S as Server
  participant R as Remote
  C->>S: req file w/ MXC URL/event ID
  activate S
  opt fetch file/attachment
    loop try potential remotes
      S->>R: req file/attachment
      activate R
      R->>R: check access of server
      R-->>S: serve file/attachment
      deactivate R
    end
    S->>S: verify MXC URL of file
  end
  S->>S: check access of user
  S-->>C: serve file
  deactivate S
  C->>C: verify MXC URL of file
```

Potential remotes here starts with the server sending the event, continuing with servers that have been in the room when the event was sent, continuing with servers in the room right now.

In the case that the origin server in the `mxc` url responds, but doesn't have the file, try to fall back to the old download endpoint, in case this is a not a new style file. Server implementations are encouraged to serve old style files on the new endpoint too, in case the media ID that is sent over does match an old style file but not a new style one.

For future reference: In case of a public file, also try fetching it from IPFS, if directly fetching it fails.

#### Extending `GET /_matrix/media/r0/attachments`

TODO(verify): We allow clients and servers to request attachments of media files. This
is most useful for servers, as they will be able to create and save the
attachments for private files, meaning future requests for that file will not
require contacting the original server for verification again.

#### Example:

Let's say a client is trying to access a private event that's not available on the client's own homeserver, and needs to be fetched from a remote homeserver.

The client receives an event containing MXC URL (`mxc://example.org/bafkreibme22gw2h7y2h7tg2fhqotaqjucnbc24deqo72b6mkl2egezxhvy`). The client requests the file via the media download endpoint, providing the optional `event_id` query parameter: `/_matrix/media/r0/download/example.com/bafkreibme22gw2h7y2h7tg2fhqotaqjucnbc24deqo72b6mkl2egezxhvy?event_id=%24abcdef&allow_remote=true`.

The client's server determines whether this is a new MXC URL by attempting to decode the content ID. Upon success, it will retrieve the file either locally or from a remote server if necessary. The endpoint for retrieving the file from a remote is the same as the one the client called, but with the `allow_remote` option set to `false`.

If the server does not have the media locally, it will ask each homeserver in the room linked to the given event ID whether it has the file. If one does, the remote homeserver will check whether the requested content has an event attached to it. If it does, the remote checks that the client's server has a user in the room with that event. If it does, the remote returns the file and attachment.

The client's server then verifies the payload from the remote. It verifies file's integrity using the MXC URL provided by the client. It then uses the attachment to ensure that this user is in the room and has access to the referenced event.

Assuming it does, the server happily serves the file, and caches it locally for
others to retrieve in future.

## Backwards Compatibility Concerns

This MSC is entirely backwards compatible for public media. Servers and
clients wishing to support authenticated media will need to be updated, but
will still be backwards compatible with media sent from older clients. Older
clients will not be able to read authenticated media, but will continue to be
able to read public media from updated clients and servers.
